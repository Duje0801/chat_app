## About 

I created a chat application using HTML, Javascript (React), SCSS and Scaledrone library. The application allows users to log in and chat with each other, as well as see who is currently online. I made sure to optimize the application for all screen sizes, ensuring that users can comfortably use the application on any device.

## What is Scaledrone?

Scaledrone is a realtime messaging service and platform that allows developers to easily add real-time communication capabilities to their applications.
